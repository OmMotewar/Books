      <h1>Met Your Next Favourite Book</h1>
      <p>It's summer, and that means more time to dive into our reading lists. Whether you've promised yourself you'll read more this year, or you simply need a new recommendation for your book club, our list of the best books of 2021 has you covered.</p>
<p>
So what should you read next? This year, there are lots of exciting new releases from some of our favorite authors, as well as stunning debut books from a diverse group of newcomers in just about every genre you can think of. For 2021, many of our top book picks (so far!) offer us critiques on our society today or a peek into complicated family dynamics; we've also got steamy romance novels that will send shivers up your spine, historical books that dip back into the past and creepy tales of suspense that will keep you up past your bedtime.</p>
<p>
Note that while some of these books may not be on shelves quite yet, you should hit that preorder button anyway; ordering books in advance not only gives you mail to look forward to that isn't a bill, but it helps support authors too. And if you think we've missed something that should be included on our list, let us know in the comments — or sound off about what you thought if you've read one of our favorites, too!</p>
